doctype is use to indicate which type of the html version we are
using or it help the browser to render the page correctly ..

id attribute ... it is use for uniquly identify the html tag 
or element in the whole code .. it is very useful 
to use css and javascipt in your code with the help of the 
id attribute.

id attribute is the global attribute beacuse it can be used in 
any html element ..

class is same way use for the group of the element that are 
same .. or you want to do same effect on the several html element 
you can use the class attribute here ...

<h1 class="imp"> hi i am important </h1>
<h1 class="not imp"> hi i am not important >/h1>
<p class="imp"> hi i am important </p>

So we have 
1. id attribute --- for single html tag
2. class attribute --- for group of html tag.


block level html element ..
element that always appear in new line when we are use 
are known as block level html element .
Examples of block elements are
<h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>.

Some elements will always
appear to continue on the
same line as their neighbouring
elements. These are known as
inline elements.Examples of inline elements are
<a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>

block level  element-- new line 
inline element -- same line 

<div> element is use for divide the page into the section
to easily undertstand the all parts of the long page 
suppose for header for body for footer for table or for form
after edning of the dev element you can use the </dev> <!-- end of the
section -->


div -- you can make sections of the page or parts of the page 
to easily handle other operation by css and javascipt

The <div> element allows you to
group a set of elements together
in one block-level box

so with the helo of the div tag Grouping Text &
Elements In a Block

<div > it is act like block level element 
<span> it is act like inline element

div and span both are use for the same purpose .. but
div is used for the block level element and span is used for 
inline element ..

div for making the page into small parts

span is use for making small parts more controlable ...
