we have button tag to combine the image and text to make it a button
<button> image button + text </button>

you can
combine text and images
between the opening <button>
tag and closing </button> tag

type="hidden"
This example also shows a
hidden form control. These form
controls are not shown on the
page (although you can see them
if you use the View Source option
in the browser). They allow web
page authors to add values to
forms that users cannot see.
For example, a web page author
might use a hidden field to
indicate which page the user was
on when they submitted a form.
