vector images are created in adobe illustrate

Vector images are created by
placing points on a grid, and
drawing lines between those
points. A color can then be
added to "fill in" the lines that
have been created.

drawings in vector format is that
you can increase the dimensions
of the image without affecting
the quality of it.

are a relatively new format used
to display vector images directly
